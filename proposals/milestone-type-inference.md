# Milestone 1 (3/4/2021) for Type Inference

1. Code and tests demonstrating that the 2 programs you chose from your proposal are working as expected

   - To reach our first Milestone Goal, we extended the existing VarInit infrastructure to support type inference for variables at the global, function, and class level when types are not provided by the programmer. 

   - NOTE: At this time all variable declarations must appear before statements. 

   - Variables may also be assigned arbitrary expressions at the first use. 

   - At this time we do not support inference for arbitrary expressions (calls, method calls, and class constuction), which breaks some of the existing tests due to the interaction between REPL and type inference. For example, when a variable `c` of type `C` is declared as follows: `c: c = None` and then later at REPL initialized with `c = C()`, this will throw an error because we'll try to infer the type of `c` from the second assignment at REPL, which at this time is unsupported. 

   - Note also that our Program 4 (see below) works as expected.
      ```
        # Program 4
        x = (1 + 3) * 2
        y = x * 2
        z = x + y
      ``` 
      

2. A description of which examples will work by March 11, including any updates you want to make to the examples you plan for March 11 (itâ€™s OK to scale back or up depending on where you got!)

   - We have chosen to drop Program 3 from our previous proposal. 
   - We have presently also decided to (potentially, most likely) drop proper Generics from our program. We have realized that a full implementation of a type-inference algorithm is a prerequisite for Generics, and so we are re-scoping to first attempt to get a working type inference algorithm for the rest of ChocoPy before considering Generics.
     - Programs 8 and 10. 

   - By March 11th, we aim to deliver: 
     - Programs 5, 6 and 7. 
     - Program 5 will require significant changes due to the fact that variable initializations are not treated as statements at present. 
     - As a 'stretch goal', we would like to do global type inference so that the type signature of functions can be inferred without type annotations (e.g., `def f(x,y):...` could be inferred). Along this line, we would like to get to a structural sub-typing algorithm to handle classes (similar to Ocaml's inference algorithm.)

3. A description of the biggest challenge you faced in your week of implementation

   The biggest change (and thus challenge) of our implementation this week was allowing for *optional* type tags when doing variable assignments. E.g., when 'declaring' a variable, one could write `x: int = 5` OR `x = 5`, and either declaration would result in `x` being correctly typed and stored in the environment. This involved adding logic to the parser and compiler that essentially merges variable 'declarations' and variable 'assignments'. This was the biggest challenge, as the parser/typechecker/compiler uses the the `varInit` node in the AST frequently. Presently, we settled on doing a series of lookups, where the *first* time a variable `x` is assigned a value, it is treated as a `varInit`, and every subsequent time an assignment is done, we verify that `x` lives in an environment where it was declared. Moreover, there were some other sub-challenges that arose from trying to overcome our biggest challenge of merging 'declarations' and 'assignments':

   - We had to make sure that type environments were correctly updated during type checking and inference. This is crucial since if a variable `x` is defined as `x = y`, and this is the *first* assignment for `x`, then this 'counts' as as declaration, which means that we must *infer* the type of `x` by inspecting the type of `y` (which was previously inferred). Note this also extends ChocoPy to declare variables in terms of expressions which may contain (previously declared) variables. In contrast, base ChocoPy can only handle variable declarations with literals.
   - We had to make sure that parameters in function declarations get stored in the environment. Consider the following program:

   ```
   def f(x : int, y : int) -> int:
     x = x + y
     return x
   ```
   In order to prevent `x = x + y` from being treated as a 'variable declaration', it is neccesary to make sure that `x` was added to the local environment by inspecting the parameter list of `f`. This bug was easy to fix, but moderately difficult to pin down.

   In conclusion, the biggest challenge of our implementation thus far was making sure that the logics of variable declaration/assignment work as intended.


# Milestone 2 (3/11/2021) for Type Inference

## Program 1

    def f(a, b):
      c: int = a + b
      return c

- Since the user has explicitly declared the value `c` to be of type `int`, we could infer that the parameters `a` and `b` ought to be type `int`.
- Currently this produces an error, and requests additional type information about `a` or `b` to infer from.
- The difficulty with this program is that the way that variable declarations with and without the type annotation are currently handled
  completely differently during the parsing stage of the compiler. This is an artifact of the class compiler, where there are deliberately
  different parsing functions set up for statements with and without variable declarations. Originally, we planned combine parsing for 
  assignments and variable declarations into a algorithm, and treat the *first* assignment as a declaration, but this would have had cascading
  effects on the class compiler, so we opted against it. In hindsight, we should have just followed through, since we ended up not merging with the
  class anyway.
- In principle, our type inference algorithm supports this program, but there needs to be a modification to allow optional (local) type annotations
  and then add those type annotations to the set of constraints that need to be solved through substitution. However, this modification is made, our
  algorithm would correctly constrain the RHS `a + b` of the declaration using `c : int` and then correctly infer the types of `a`, `b`, and the
  return type of `f`.

## Program 2

    def g(z: int): 
      def f(y): 
        return y + 1
      x = f(1)

- This program was one of our originally specified programs in our proposal. 
- However, due to time constrains we have not been able to complete a merge with `main` to give the machinary to parse and run this program.
  In particular, our compiler has no parsing support for nested function bodies, so we cannot even proceed from the parsing stage to the type
  inference and type checking stage.
- That said, with modifications to take into count how such function bodies would be processed, our existing function inference ought to 
  support this program as expected. For example, provided some infrastructure to gather definition of `f`, we could simply call `inferReturnType`
  on that definition to get a fully typed definition for `f` (the parameter `y` of `f` is also inferred by this),
  which we could use to successfully type check `x`. Finally `inferReturnType` would see that `g` doesn't supply a `return` statement, so
  its return type is `None`.

## Program 3

    class A(object):
      x: int = 0

    def g(a): 
      return a.x
    
    g(A())

- Initially we aimed to implement inference for classes, however we were not able to do so on time. 
- Our original approach was to use row polymorphism to solve this constraint problem. Using row polymosphism, we can judge by the fact that the return statement of `g` has a field lookup of object `a` that `a` is an object that contains a field `x`. Our thoughts were that we could assign objects of this nature an "open object" type and handle the constraint problem during unification. We initially tried to resolve the "open-objects" during inference through a process of "closing" the object types, but as we soon realized, this cannot be done ahead of time and for this approach to work we will need to heavily modify the type checker and code generation machinery to handle these objects dynamically, which we judged to be unrealistic given the limited time that we had.
